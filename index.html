<p>Introduction</p>

<p>
The pitch I am proposing is to get an understanding of the percentage of people who still get their news through print and why? I would like to use data analytics to better understand how many, why, and if it is efficient for news organizations and the environment to continue using print or go entirely digital. Icons I would use are ones like this to indicate print or paper.

<p>With digital being the main content spreader for publications of traditional print, why are publications still manufacturing print? As circulation slid, so did revenue: Newspaper Publishers revenue in 2020 was less than half what it was in 2002, dropping from $46.2 billion to $22.1 billion, according to the SAS. There was a 27.8% decrease in revenue from 2002 to 2010, and a 33.6% decrease from 2010 to 2020.
Periodical Publishing, which includes medical and scientific journals, religious and scholastic magazines, and other specialty publications, took a similar hit.
Estimated revenue from Periodical Publishing dropped from $40.2 billion in 2002 to $23.9 billion in 2020. There was a 20.7% revenue decline from 2002 to 2010, and a 25.0% decrease from 2010 to 2020. Regardless of the type of packaging you choose for your brand, itâ€™s important to take into consideration the carbon footprint and emissions released during production. 
The great news about digital printers is that they produce far less CO2 emissions than many traditional and rovograture printing presses. At ePac, our HP Indigo 20000 presses are carbon neutral, allowing the process of digitally printing our pouches and rollstock to have a lower environmental impact than conventional printing. 
A reduction in emissions = a happier earth. Your financial costs a publisher will be considerably less online, but your investment in time will be about the same, if not greater. You will also need different skills in an online environment, such as HTML coding, and using FTP to edit your documents once online.
